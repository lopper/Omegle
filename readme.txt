A simple Omegle Library written in objective-c. Works great for implementing Omegle features in your OS X or iOS apps, tested to work for both. Hit me up if you end up using it in a project! 

If you have a simple question send me an email! pjbcool100@gmail.com, but please note that I will not help you integrate this or add a feature for you (feel free to fork it and add a feature if you want!)
